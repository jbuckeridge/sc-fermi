**************************************************************

The program calculates the self-consistent Fermi level and defect
concentrations given a set of formation energies (at VBM).

It is currently designed to work with VASP input i.e. the 
POSCAR for which the DOS has been calculated is required. The
DOS should be present in a file called 'totdos.dat' which
is 2 (or 3 for spin polarised) columned, with energy and DOS
in the columns. The energy scale must be given with the VBM
(or Fermi level for a metal) set to zero (in eV). The DOS is
assumed to be in #states/cell.

The code uses a statistical mechanical approach to calculate
the concentrations of each defect in each charge state,
balanced by the free carrier concentrations from the DOS. 
Relevant equations can be found in e.g. Ashcroft and Mermin
chapter 28. The output gives a breakdown on the concentrations
in each charge state (unless the total is zero).

frozen-sc-fermi can be used to fix a particular defect 
concentration to a value of interest. You can fix the total
concentration of a defect in your original list, or one or 
more charge states (or both). You can also add extra defects
with fixed concentrations, but these must be given a 
particular charge state.

Please see the input files in the example directory, they 
should be self-explanatory.

Any questions please email me (see above).
